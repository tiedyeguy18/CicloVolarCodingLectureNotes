In this assignment, you will write a program to take a customer's order at a restaurant.

The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of variables, printing (with formatting), and taking user input.

Expected:

Introduce yourself as their waiter.
Ask what your customer wants to eat.
Ask how much their item costs.
Repeat back to them what they ordered and how much they owe you.
Without running the program below, make a prediction of what it prints. Put your prediction in a comment in your submission (start the line with a #).

Here's a sample of how it should work (don't worry about the exact wording):

Hi, my name is Jamin and I'll be your waiter for tonight. What can I get you started with?
Hamburger
Alright, and how many dollars does that cost?
7
Sounds good. You ordered a Hamburger, so your total is $7.

For number 5:

if 5 < 3:
    print("success")
else:
    print("failure")

More advanced (in increasing level of difficulty):

Apply a 7% tax to what they owe.
Ask what percent they would like to tip, then change their total accordingly.
Reject bad input (non-numbers or negative numbers)
Implement a menu (so instead of asking the customer for the price, you look up the price of their item on the menu). If their item is not on the menu, quit.
Keep asking for the customer's input if they say an invalid number or menu item.
Take the orders of a table of customers, then give what they ordered and their total.
Make an industrial restaurant management system.
