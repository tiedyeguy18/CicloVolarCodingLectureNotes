In this assignment, you will write a program that always wins in the game “rock, paper, scissors.”

The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of conditionals (if statements).

Expected:

Get the user to input their move.
If the move is not allowed (not one of rock, paper, or scissors), end the program
Beat the player by saying your move (or if you're feeling nice, let the player win every time).
Without running the program below, make a prediction of what it prints. Put your prediction in a comment in your submission.

Here's a sample of how it should work (don't worry about the exact wording):

Welcome to rock, paper, scissors! Make your play.
> rock
I play paper, I win!

For number 4:

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

More advanced (in increasing level of difficulty):

Add more than just rock, paper, scissors: https://cjleo.com/2020/05/25/why-we-dont-play-rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/.
Play randomly.
Keep asking for input until the user says one of the valid options.
Implement some kind of prediction. If I play only paper against your program for a while, I should start losing.
Use an image processing library to detect rock, paper or scissors from a live video feed
